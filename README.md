# Coffee Machine V2

This program is the updated version of the code used from day 15 to make a coffee machine run. 

It now incorporates classes as supplied and all files in this repository needed to make it run. In comparison to the previous machine, the solution is really simple and elegant! Note how the classes have methods and functions which take their input from a short program contained within the while loop.
